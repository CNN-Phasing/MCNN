The MCNN model is defined in file `mcnn_door_mirror_model.py`, the training configuration is in `mcnn_door_mirror.py`.
As it is not possible to upload big files to github, all the acquired dataset which were compressed in 4 seperated files are uncompressed to folder `dataset` in 4 different folders.

Reconstruction result from our camera-recorded images (frames [0, 255)) are presented in a video. This video is located in folder `extended.videos`. The ground-truth, the absolute value error images are presented in the same video for a visual comparison.
