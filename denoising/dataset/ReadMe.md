We have tested our denoising application with more than TB raw STEM images, but the files are too large to fit github.
Please contact Feng Wang (feng.wang@empa.ch) directly in case you need them.

Typical denoising videos can be found in folder `../extended.videos`.

Two typical experimental dataset are available [here](http://144.91.70.240/d/25822e291351488780e5/).
The simulation code to generate the training set can be found in file `../data_loader.py`.
