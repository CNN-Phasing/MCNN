The first video, `Extended.Video.2.mcnn.denosing.512x512.mov`, shows how a Pt cluster is reconstructing. The raw data is acquired at 15 fps, but this videoframe rate is 2fps.

The second video, `Extended.Video.3.pgure-svt.mcnn.denoising.benchmark.128x128.mov`, shows the denosing benchmark between our denoising neural netwrok with the pgure-svt algorithm. The raw data is acquired at 150 fps, but this video framerate is 2 fps.
